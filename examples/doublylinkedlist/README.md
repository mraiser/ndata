The purpose of this example is not to demonstrate the *best* way to write a doubly 
linked list in Rust, but rather to demonstrate the *easiest* way. The very things 
that make Rust such a great language can arguably get in the way of rapid prototyping. 
NData allows you to write Rust code without worrying (as much) about type safety and 
ownership.
